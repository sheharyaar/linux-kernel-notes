- C fundamentals (unions, structs, typedefs, pointers, pointers vs arrays, etc.)
- callbacks and function pointers
- macros and preprocessors
- scope (extern, static, etc.)
- linking libraries and ability to work with Makefile and KConfig Files
- generation of static and shared (`.so`) libraries
-  Debugging
	- Fluent in using GDB, Valgrid, strace, ptrace, etc. debugging and tracing tools

### Resources
- ==Pointers on C Book by Kenneth A. Reek== (**highly recommended**) - teaches you pointers and other important topics
- [Beejâ€™s Guide to C Programming](https://beej.us/guide/bgc/html/split/) for basics and fundamental C
- Expert C Programming by van der Linden, Peter

## Operating Systems Concepts
- You need overall knowledge of working of operating systems
- Knowledge of userspace linux APIs and syscalls is highly recommended

### Resources
- [Operating Systems Concept by Abraham Silberschatz](https://os-book.com/) or [Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)
- ==MIT 6.1810 or 6.828 : Operating System Engineering== (Labs + xv6 book is **must**) - [link](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2023/index.html). This will give you the important prerequisites and the confidence to explore into the kernel. Remember, complete all the labs.
