# Syscalls

- Provides a layer between the user-space and the hardware
- These are **not** function calls, but these are **assembly instructions** 
- These instructions perform the following :
	- setup information to identify the system call and itâ€™s parameters
	- trigger a kernel mode switch
	- retrieve the result of the system call
