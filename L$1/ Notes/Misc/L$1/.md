- this pointer denotes the current running task on a CPU.  
- it is accessible only in process context and not interrupts.  
- it is defined in `<arch/x86/include/asm/current.h>` for x86 processors  
```c  
static __always_inline struct task_struct *get_current(void)  
{  
	if (IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_USE_X86_SEG_SUPPORT))  
		return this_cpu_read_const(const_pcpu_hot.current_task);  
  
	return this_cpu_read_stable(pcpu_hot.current_task);  
}  
```  
- returns `task_struct` for the current task running on the CPU  
  
> `this_cpu_read_const` and `this_cpu_read_stable` are used to obtain per-cpu variables. More information is given at `<arch/x86/include/asm/percpu.h>`  
  
```  
this_cpu_read() makes gcc load the percpu variable every time it is  
accessed while this_cpu_read_stable() allows the value to be cached.  
this_cpu_read_stable() is more efficient and can be used if its value  
is guaranteed to be valid across cpus.  The current users include  
pcpu_hot.current_task and pcpu_hot.top_of_stack, both of which are  
actually per-thread variables implemented as per-CPU variables and  
thus stable for the duration of the respective task.
